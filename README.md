### What I learned

I am proud to have gotten it where I wanted it finally! It's crazy how much I learned in this project so now there are plenty of things I would do differently that I would do next time.

Ran into plenty of snags, but lots of tenacity, time, and AI/Google I was able to work out all challenges- except one.

In mobile sizes, the user result and computer result jump when the computer's result is shown as if there is a layout change, but I have tried out everything to try and fix if that is indeed the issue. It jumps just as the computer's result is shown so it must be around there?

I ran into an issue when trying to add the cycling animation, trying many different approaches and I realized the reason was a opacity: 0; in the CSS instead of a flaw with my problem solving approach. Seems to happen a lot.
